# Calibration Camera Integration Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ConsentModal Test Error
**Problem**: ConsentModal test was importing from TSX file but component was converted to JSX
**Solution**: Updated import in `src/components/ui/__tests__/ConsentModal.test.tsx` to import from `.jsx` file
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed - Test now passes

### 2. React Version Mismatch
**Problem**: React 19.1.1 vs react-dom 19.1.0 version mismatch causing test failures
**Solution**: Synchronized React versions to 19.1.0 in package.json
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

### 3. Jest Setup Issue
**Problem**: `toHaveNoViolations` matcher not properly imported from jest-axe
**Solution**: Fixed import syntax in jest.setup.js
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed

### 4. Gaze Calibration Camera Integration
**Problem**: Camera was not properly initialized during calibration, causing calibration to loop
**Solution**: 
- Added `useCameraManager` hook to `CalibrationWizard`
- Added camera stream validation to all calibration components
- Added camera status checks and error handling
- Pass `cameraStream` prop to all calibration steps

**Changes Made**:
- `CalibrationWizard.tsx`: Added camera manager integration
- `CalibrationDots.tsx`: Added camera stream validation
- `EnvironmentCheck.tsx`: Added camera stream validation  
- `HeadMovementGuide.tsx`: Added camera stream validation

**Key Features Added**:
- Camera initialization on calibration start
- Camera error handling and retry functionality
- Visual feedback when camera is not active
- Automatic camera cleanup on component unmount
- Camera stream health monitoring during calibration

## Camera Integration Flow

1. **Initialization**: CalibrationWizard automatically starts camera when mounted
2. **Validation**: Each calibration step validates camera is active before proceeding
3. **Error Handling**: Shows clear error messages if camera fails
4. **Retry Logic**: Allows users to retry camera initialization
5. **Cleanup**: Properly cleans up camera resources when done

## Status Indicators

Each calibration step now shows:
- ‚ùå "Camera Not Active" if camera is off
- ‚úÖ "Camera Active" when camera is working
- üîÑ Loading states during camera initialization
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Error messages with retry options

## Testing

- ConsentModal tests: ‚úÖ Passing
- Camera integration: ‚úÖ Implemented
- Error handling: ‚úÖ Implemented
- TypeScript compilation: ‚ö†Ô∏è Has unrelated errors in test files

## Next Steps

The core camera integration is complete. The calibration should now:
1. Properly initialize the camera before starting
2. Validate camera is active during each step
3. Show clear feedback to users about camera status
4. Handle camera errors gracefully
5. Not loop endlessly due to missing camera

The remaining TypeScript errors are in test files and don't affect the main functionality.
