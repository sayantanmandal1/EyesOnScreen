# Eyes on Screen Quiz - Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Dependency Conflicts (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: `@testing-library/react-hooks@8.0.1` was incompatible with React 19
**Solution**: 
- Removed `@testing-library/react-hooks` from package.json
- The `renderHook` function is now available in `@testing-library/react` v16.3.0+
- Added `@playwright/test` for E2E testing
- Updated CI to use `--legacy-peer-deps` flag

### 2. TypeScript Errors (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: Multiple TypeScript compilation errors
**Solutions**:
- Fixed `useRef()` without type parameter in `ConfidenceMeter.tsx`
- Fixed event listener type issues in `IntegrityEnforcer.ts` by casting events
- Replaced deprecated `substr()` with `substring()` method
- Fixed `useImperativeHandle` usage in `AlertManager.tsx` with proper `forwardRef`
- Fixed broken interface declarations in calibration components
- Renamed `.ts` files containing JSX to `.tsx` files

### 3. Jest Configuration (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: Broken Jest configuration with syntax errors
**Solution**: 
- Fixed moduleNameMapper configuration
- Corrected string literal termination

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: GitHub Actions workflow failing due to dependency conflicts
**Solutions**:
- Added `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to all npm install commands
- Added Playwright browser installation steps
- Created basic Playwright configuration
- Added basic E2E test file

### 5. Build Configuration
**Problem**: Missing Playwright configuration
**Solution**:
- Created `playwright.config.ts` with proper browser configurations
- Added basic E2E test structure

## Files Modified

### Core Fixes
- `package.json` - Removed incompatible dependency, added Playwright
- `jest.config.js` - Fixed syntax errors
- `src/components/monitoring/ConfidenceMeter.tsx` - Fixed useRef typing
- `src/lib/quiz/IntegrityEnforcer.ts` - Fixed event listener types, replaced substr
- `src/components/ui/AlertManager.tsx` - Fixed useImperativeHandle with forwardRef
- `src/components/calibration/CalibrationDots.tsx` - Fixed broken interface
- `src/components/calibration/HeadMovementGuide.tsx` - Fixed broken interface
- `src/components/calibration/CalibrationPointDisplay.tsx` - Removed non-existent property

### CI/CD
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Added legacy-peer-deps and Playwright setup
- `playwright.config.ts` - Created Playwright configuration
- `src/__tests__/e2e/basic.spec.ts` - Added basic E2E test

### File Renames
- `src/__tests__/visual/visual-regression.test.ts` → `.tsx`
- `src/__tests__/integration/accessibility.integration.test.ts` → `.tsx`

## Current Status

✅ **RESOLVED**: 
- Dependency installation works with `npm ci --legacy-peer-deps`
- Build process completes successfully with `npm run build`
- TypeScript compilation passes (with Turbopack)
- Basic project structure is functional

⚠️ **REMAINING ISSUES** (Non-blocking):
- ESLint warnings about `any` types (315 errors, 122 warnings)
- Missing dependencies in React hooks
- Unused variables
- Unescaped entities in JSX

## Next Steps

1. **For Production**: Address ESLint errors by:
   - Replacing `any` types with proper TypeScript interfaces
   - Adding missing hook dependencies
   - Removing unused variables
   - Escaping JSX entities

2. **For Development**: The current state allows:
   - Full application build
   - Development server startup
   - Basic testing infrastructure
   - CI/CD pipeline execution

## Commands That Now Work

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Build the application
npm run build

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run type checking
npm run type-check

# Run tests (with warnings)
npm test
```

## Notes

- The application builds successfully with Next.js 15.5.0 and Turbopack
- React 19 compatibility is maintained
- All critical functionality should work as expected
- ESLint issues are primarily code quality concerns, not functional blockers
